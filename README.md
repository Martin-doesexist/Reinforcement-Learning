# Reinforcement-Learning

The model takes the historical data of price & volume in stock martkets, split the data into train and test data, then use reinforcement learning to train the agent. Once the training is done, then you can use the trained agent to label the buy/sell points in test data. You then have an idea of how good the agent performs in predicting this stock. If you are happy with the result, then you can apply it to the latest(current) data to assist you determine whether to buy or sell the stock giving the existing data.
